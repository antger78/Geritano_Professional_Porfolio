# Description/Reflection

In this assignment, we were tasked with making our first bit of original code using the skills we'd leard in the weeks prior, to create our own portfolio page.  The assignment was challenging and in the end, approaching the final deadline, I ran into a snag I failed to resolve before submission.  I was unable to get rid of gaps underneath my images in the cards I created for the page.  Otherwise, the page is responsive to changes in screensizes and renders very well on mobile.  Resume is downloadable, telephone number is active and can be called, links work well in page, div elements overlay on top of their appproprate elements, images grayscale when hovered over, etc.  Overall, I know there will be some reworking that will need to be done.  Had I started sooner on this assignment, I'd have had more time to reach out to the teaching staff for assistance, and will do so in the future.
