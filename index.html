                I was born in the Bronx, New York in 1997 to young parents, Widy and Anthony.  My mother was born in the Dominican Republic and my father was born in the Bronx as well.  I grew up there until I was 8 years old at which point we moved to Bay Shore, NY, on Long Island.  I lived there until I moved to New Haven CT. to attend Yale University, where I graduated from in 2020 in the midst of the pandemic.  I got work that summer at a lab in Branford CT. for a genomics company, Sema4 Genomics, and would be moved to the Laboratory Informatics Management System team in April of 2021.  Upon working in that department, it became clear to really do the best possible in that department, I would need to learn to code.  Thus, I joined the Columbia Coding bootcamp! I'm having a great time!
